# Portfolio

First project for the Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree course; my portfolio features a few projects from Udacity's Fullstack Web Developer Course. Using Bootstrap and jQuery, I was able to create a responsive and interactive portfolio website. Resources included are the original photos and Gulp setup used to manipulate some of the images for this project.

**Note: Gulp was not used to manipulate `img_src/me.jpg`; photoshop was used to get different crops for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.**
